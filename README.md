it is consist from 5 problems 
1. Face Blurring: You are expected to write an algorithm that blurs out people's faces in any
given colored image without affecting the remaining parts of the image, if any face exists.
2.  Face Mask Detection: Given an image with a face of a person, you are expected to build a
model that classifies whether that person is wearing a mask or not.
3.  Wrapper Class Library: Given the created model in problem #2, you are expected to create
a .net 6 class library (in c#) that loads an image from file path along with the model, and infer whether
the person in the image is wearing a mask or not.
4. Image Statistics: Given a gray scale image (8 bpp), you are expected to create a .net 6 class
that loads an image, and calculate the image statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum and
maximum gray value) without using any third party library.
5.  Time Series Prediction: Given the dataset "prices.txt" which is a comma separated file
consisting of the closing price of a certain stock for the past 5 years, you are expected to create a
"machine learning model" that can accurately predict the most recent 20% prices.
